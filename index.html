            Lucille Tenazas is an educator and graphic designer based in New York. She is the Henry Wolf Professor of Communication Design at Parsons School of Design and currently the Associate Dean in the School of Art, Media and Technology (AMT). Previously, she taught at California College of the Arts in San Francisco for 20 years where she developed a graduate curriculum with an interdisciplinary approach and focus on form-giving, teaching and leadership. Her work is at the intersection of typography and linguistics, with design that reflects complex and poetic means of visual expression.
            <br><br>Originally from Manila, the Philippines, she has taught and practiced in the United States since 1979, a trajectory that included living in San Francisco; Rome, Italy; and New York. Her first experience of living in a design environment was as a graduate student at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan in the early â€˜80s, exposed to the work of Eliel and Eero Saarinen, and Charles and Ray Eames.
            <br><br>Lucille is an authority in the evolving state of design education. She has lectured and conducted workshops in institutions throughout the United States, Asia and Europe. From 1996-1998, she served as the national president of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), representing the first appointment outside of New York in the organization's then 80-year history. She is the recipient of the AIGA Medal in 2013 in recognition of her lifetime contribution to design practice and outstanding leadership in design education.
